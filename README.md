# pickseat

Pickseat is a carpooling web app that allows you to become friend with stranger who has the same route as you

My first real project ! Hope you will like it as much as i did, it was a course project to finish my third year at UFRA.

There's still a lot of rooms for upgrade, but i prefer to let the app like that, as a remainder of what my first project looks like.

I am sorry, my app is in french (it is my native langage), hope you don't mind using google translate ! 

I did my best to present an intuitive and pretty UI using angular 8, leaflet.Js and bootstrap. I also tried to secure my back as much as i could think of at the moment.
I also downloaded a SSL certificate in case it'll be published.

If you want to test it out, clone it, open both front and back end folders, and enter "npm start" in their respective terminal.
Please, do consider that the database is not online.
