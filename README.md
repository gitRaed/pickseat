My first real project ! Hope you will like it as much as i did, it was a course project i found on my own to finish my third year at UFRA.

There's still a lot of rooms for upgrade, but i prefered to let the app like that, as a remainder of what my first project looks like.

I am sorry, my app is in french(it is my native langage) hope you don't mind using google translate ! 

I did my best to present an intuitive and pretty UI using angular 8, leaflet.Js and bootstrap. I also tried to secure my back as much as i could think of at the moment.
I also downloaded a SSL certificate in case it'll be published.

If you want to test it out, clone it and enter "npm start" in the terminal.
