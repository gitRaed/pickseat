My first real project ! Hope you will like it as much as i did, it was a course project i found on my own to finish my third year at UFRA.
There's still a lot of rooms for upgrade, but i prefered to let the app like that, as a remainder of what my first project looks like.
I am sorry, my app is in french(it is my native langage) hope you don't mind using google translate ! 
I did my best to present an intuitive and pretty UI using leaflet and bootstrap. I also tried to secure my back as much as i could think of at the moment
